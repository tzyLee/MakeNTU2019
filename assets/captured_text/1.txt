CHAPTER 7 Transmission Lines for Communications
In Chapter 6, we introduced the transmission line and studied propagation and bouncing of waves along a line, a topic applicable to digital electronics. In this chapter, we are concerned with the steady-state analysis of transmission-line systems excited by sinusoidally time-varying sources, a topic that is generally applicable to communication systems. We recall from Chapter 6 that the phenomenon on a transmission line excited by a source connected to the line at a certain instant of time, say, t = 0, consists of the transient bouncing of (+) and (-) waves along the line for t > 0. In the steady state, the situation is equivalent to the superposition of one (+) wave, which is the sum of all the transient (+) waves, and one (--) wave, which is the sum of all the transient (-) waves. Thus, the general solutions for the line voltage and line current in the sinusoidal steady state are superpositions of voltages and currents, respectively, of sinusoidal (+) and (-) waves. We shall first write these general solutions and then discuss several topics pertinent to sinusoidal steady-state analysis of transmission-line systems.
We introduce the standing-wave concept by first considering the particular case of a short-circuited line and then the general case of a line terminated by an arbitrary load. We discuss several techniques of transmission-line matching. In this connection, we introduce the Smith chart, a useful graphical aid in the solution of transmission-line problems. Finally, we extend our treatment of sinusoidal steady-state analysis to lossy lines and also consider two special cases of pulses on lossy lines.
Although the concepts and techniques discussed in this chapter are based on the analysis of transmission-line systems, many of these are also applicable to the analysis of other, analogous systems. Examples are uniform plane wave propagation involving multiple media, as in Section 4.7, and discontinuities in waveguides, considered in Chapters 8 and 9.
